2nd Term Exercise Netze
- Praktikum 2; 
- Praktikum 3 Ipv6 Discovery; heise.de maybe good, because not all have Ipv6
Maybe better to set up a VPN to lab? For ipv6 outside access


- Praktikum 4 Router building -> Good to not change
New Routing Exercises?
In general, new Exercises?

--> All exercises doable on each and every machine, no special scenario


4th Term Exercise Internetkommunikation
- TCP Exercises, Analyses of TCP protocol and streams
- HTTP Exercises -> In Containers? In Kubernetes?
--> Specialized use cases, good candidate for virtualization


Master term Servicemanagment in Netzen
- Complex ready scenario (K8s/Swarm) where the exercises use this ready scenario


Protocol:

	- Basic setup
	- Same ground between exercise?
	- Master niveau is different from bachelor niveau: Masters should do it all on their onwn?
